userInterface creates a new (instance?) of the program via variable = userInterface

the eventListeners need to be added inside this function.
If they aren't, ie if they are added when the buttons etc are created, things will be out of order.
As in, the target function might not have been read by the program yet.

In any case, clicking a button can send a message to userInterface about what was clicked.

This message is sent to the new instance of the program.

The new instance of the program contains the data.
(Dummy data created by an outside funtion can be sent to the instance)

It combines this information, and sends it to displayContent()
